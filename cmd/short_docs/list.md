# List Traces

Browse recorded traces locally and optionally run one immediately.

- [Local] Loads traces from `.tusk/traces` by default (or `--trace-dir`).
- [Cloud] Loads traces from Tusk Drift Cloud by passing `-c` / `--cloud`.
- Interactive table with navigation; press Enter on a row to run that single test with default `tusk run` behavior.

See `tusk run --help` for more details on how traces are replayed.
